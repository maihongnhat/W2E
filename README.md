Bánh bèo is a heritage dish of central Vietnam; it is especially famous in Hue, Quang Nam and Da Nang. Bánh bèo nhân ướt is explained as a typical style of bánh bèo in Đà Nẵng which can be eaten straight from the bowl using a spoon. You can add some fish sauce or tangy chilli sauce to go with it. Order bánh bèo chén and they’d bring out a tray of 5-6 bowls.

Similar to Pho, Bún is a much richer beef noodle soup in the central and south region. At Bà Diệu (or some people call it Bún Trần Tống because of its location), their broth is made with generous amount of beef ribs cooked for long hours and it’s very flavourful. Rice noodles are usually tossed and drenched over the comforting beef broth and accompanied with different parts of beef such as rare steak, flank, tendon, meatballs etc. To make it easy, just order a “thập cẩm” which means one bowl with all of them. Because they make excellent broth, it is usually sold out by 7pm (they open about 2pm), so better go there early.

Bánh mì thịt nguội pairs freshly toasted baguette with jambon, cha, pate and accompaniments like chilli, cucumber and spring onion. One of the most popular shop selling banh mi thit nguoi in Danang is Ba Lan. It’s so good and famous that there’re already numerous ‘fake’ banh mi Ba Lans everywhere to derive the brand name. I’m pretty sure that the real shop is at 62 Trung Nu Vuong. Very generous amount of fillings as can be seen from the photo above.

My favourite amongst all dishes is Bánh xèo from Bà Dưỡng. I love it that we have to walk through a narrow alley to reach this hole-in-the-wall food joint. This is known to be serving one of the best bánh xèo in town. Bánh xèo is a crackling rice flour crepe filled with bean sprouts, shrimp, spring onions, and mung beans. Bà Dưỡng literally means “Mrs Duong” and it is always crowded. There is a open kitchen space where the ladies were all busy cooking the pancakes. Served with pork skewers, rice paper, I like how crispy the pancake is. So what you have to do is to wrap the ingredients with rice paper and dip it into their special sauce. Don’t worry, no fish sauce is added. Well, how special are the sauces? It’s mixed with peanut, hoisin sauce, peanuts, chillies and pork liver which is so thick and tasty. One huge mouthful and you get a blast of flavours from the savouriness to sweetness, balanced with the secret sauce.
